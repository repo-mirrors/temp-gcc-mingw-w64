gcc-mingw-w64 for Debian
------------------------

This package provides the standard Debian gcc, built to target Windows
using MinGW-w64: the resulting executables and DLLs won't require any
runtime DLL beyond those you'd expect (any library explicitly used,
and potentially libgcc and/or libstdc++).

gcc is configured as follows:
* static and shared builds are supported;
* multilib is not supported (use explicit 32- or 64-bit targets
  instead);
* exceptions use setjump/longjump ("SJLJ exceptions") on 32-bit
  Windows, structured exception handling (SEH) on 64-bit Windows;
* LTO is supported;
* GOMP is enabled;
* language front-ends are built for C, C++, Fortran, Ada, Objective-C
  and Objective-C++.

Both Windows and POSIX threading models are supported; the default
model is Windows, but it can be changed using alternatives. The
threading model can also be selected explicitly by specifying the
appropriate compiler; for example, i686-w64-mingw32-gcc-posix for
POSIX-threaded 32-bit C code, x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++-win32 for
Windows-threaded 64-bit C++ code.

To use this package to build Windows software, simply use the
appropriate target:
* i686-w64-mingw32 for 32-bit Windows;
* x86_64-w64-mingw32 for 64-bit Windows.
