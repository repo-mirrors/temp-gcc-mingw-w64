gcc-mingw-w64 (11) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Stop building gnat on armhf, it doesn't work currently.

 -- Stephen Kitt <skitt@debian.org>  Thu, 02 Jan 2014 08:00:43 +0100

gcc-mingw-w64 (10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build with gcc 4.8:
    - stringstream ignores _GLIBCXX_DEBUG (Closes: #703935);
    - update debian/copyright using that from gcc-4.8;
    - switch to libcloog-isl-dev.
  * Enable POSIX threads support using winpthreads (Closes: #697220).
  * Enable OpenMP support (Closes: #571773).
  * Drop the transitional gcc-mingw32 package.

gcc-mingw-w64 (9) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Use dpkg-vendor instead of lsb-release; thanks to Didier 'OdyX' Raboud
    for the patch (Closes: #671725).
  * Drop references to mingw-w64-dev (Closes: #726283).
  * Add README.Debian describing the gcc configuration (Closes: #540733).
  * Switch to my Debian address and drop DMUA.
  * Use canonical VCS URIs.
  * Standards-Version 3.9.4, no change required.

 -- Stephen Kitt <skitt@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Oct 2013 07:22:06 +0200

gcc-mingw-w64 (8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replace /usr/share/doc/gcc-mingw32 with a symlink when necessary
    (Closes: #690148).
  * Provide amd64 compatibility symlinks in gcc-mingw32, preserving the
    functionality of the Squeeze version (Closes: #695736); add g++
    compatibility symlink (Closes: #682257).

 -- Stephen Kitt <steve@sk2.org>  Wed, 12 Dec 2012 07:30:14 +0100

gcc-mingw-w64 (7) unstable; urgency=low

  * When upgrading from versions where /usr/share/doc/gcc-mingw-w64 is a
    directory, force its replacement with a symlink (Closes: #683617).

 -- Stephen Kitt <steve@sk2.org>  Wed, 08 Aug 2012 08:21:56 +0200

gcc-mingw-w64 (6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle the different split-package versions in Ubuntu and Debian.
  * Add transitional "Recommends" so that gcc-mingw-w64 pulls in the
    compilers it used to provide (LP: #992217).
  * Make gcc-mingw32 install compatibility symlinks for binaries and
    manpages formerly provided by mingw32-binutils (LP: #992161).
  * Enable Ada support on armhf and hurd-i386 now that gnat-4.6 is
    available there.

 -- Stephen Kitt <steve@sk2.org>  Sat, 05 May 2012 12:33:32 +0200

gcc-mingw-w64 (5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add the DMUA flag set by Didier Raboud to the control.source file.
  * Add a warning to the generated debian/control file indicating that
    it shouldn't be modified directly.
  * Fix the version for Breaks/Replaces at 4.6.3-3+4, since this is the
    earliest version of the post-split package in the archive. Fixing
    the version avoids making the package set uninstallable.

gcc-mingw-w64 (4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Stephen Kitt ]
  * Split package into gcc, g++, gfortran and gnat packages.
  * Enable the Objective-C and Objective-C++ compilers.
  * Split package into 32- and 64-bit specific versions (-i686 and
    -x86-64) - see thread starting at
    http://lists.debian.org/4EBA730A.7060707@greffrath.com for rationale.
  * Build with gcc-4.6 explicitly, at least until gnat-4.7 is available
    (Closes: #667173).
  * Standards-Version 3.9.3, no change required.
  * Provide a transitional gcc-mingw32 package for backwards-
    compatibility (Closes: #644769); in addition, with regards to bugs
    filed against gcc-mingw32:
    - gcc-mingw-w64's version of mm_malloc.h is correct (Closes: #651300);
    - gcc-mingw-w64 compiles programs (Closes: #658619);
    - gcc-mingw-w64 provides shared versions of libgcc and libstdc++
      (Closes: #540783);
    - the packages' dependency structure ensures that the various compiler
      packages depend on the appropriate development packages (Closes:
      #567698).
  * Update debian/copyright using the version provided by gcc-4.6.

  [ Didier Raboud ]
  * Confidently set the DM-Upload-Allowed flag to yes.

 -- Stephen Kitt <steve@sk2.org>  Mon, 16 Apr 2012 08:46:45 +0200

gcc-mingw-w64 (3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable Ada support on armhf and hurd-i386 for now, based on a patch
    by Peter Green (Closes: #658526).
  * Wrap-and-sort debian/control.full.
  * Check before moving libraries, when bootstrapping there is nothing
    to move.
  * Update debian/control.bootstrap with changes made to
    debian/control.full.
  * Add spelling fix for "writting".

 -- Stephen Kitt <steve@sk2.org>  Sun, 12 Feb 2012 23:24:00 +0100

gcc-mingw-w64 (2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Export all relevant flags from dpkg-buildflags; in particular this
    allows building with a stack-protector-enabling compiler (as on
    Ubuntu).

 -- Stephen Kitt <steve@sk2.org>  Mon, 24 Oct 2011 01:18:56 +0200

gcc-mingw-w64 (1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include Ada support (Closes: #632375). Build-depend on gcc-4.6-source
    4.6.1-5 or later to get the required upstream fixes.
  * Stop trying to ship libiberty, upstream no longer supports it
    (Closes: #634567).
  * Protect intrinsics in C++ code (Closes: #633552).
  * Provide shared versions of DLL-compatible libraries (Closes:
    #625778). The appropriate DLLs may have to be shipped with the
    resulting binaries, unless static build options are used (-static,
    -static-libgcc and/or -static-libstdc++).
  * Re-organise configure flags and update them as used upstream.
  * Switch to single-number versions and add the gcc-mingw-w64 version to
    the resulting binary package's version.
  * Disable hardening with dpkg-dev >= 1.16.1 for now (until the gcc-4.6
    package supports it).
  * Correct uses of "informations" in output code.

gcc-mingw-w64 (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ship libiberty (Closes: #626117).
  * Enable fully dynamic strings (Closes: #626956).
  * Switch to gcc 4.6.
  * Install the LTO plugin (Closes: #625901).
  * Require binutils 2.21.51.20110523 to avoid LTO-related segfaults (see
    http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12693 for details).
  * Avoid attempting to build libstdc++-pic.a.
  * Drop leading "The" from the package description.
  * Strip the libraries.
  * Build-depend on libcloog-ppl-dev to enable extra optimisations.
  * Link with "--as-needed" to limit dependencies to those actually
    needed.

 -- Stephen Kitt <steve@sk2.org>  Tue, 31 May 2011 23:40:07 +0200

gcc-mingw-w64 (0.2) unstable; urgency=low
